      The OSU MGR is funded by NSF to provide curation for marine geological
      samples. Curation and sample dissemination is therefore a central part of
      the OSU MGR’s activities. The core lab is equipped with, and has access to
      a range of equipment that can be used to measure cores. Some of this is
      included under standard curation practice, others require fees.

      To use our equipment and/or instrumentation listed below, please submit an
      [Analytical Request](/analytical-requests).
