      ## **GLAcial Sedimentation School (GLASS):**


      ## **Interpreting past climate using Antarctic and Greenland sediment
      cores**


      #### **Dates**: 23–27 May 2022


      #### **Location**: Oregon State University Marine and Geology Repository
      (OSU-MGR), Corvallis, OR, USA


      #### **Deadline to apply**: 7 January 2022


      ## **School Objectives**


      Increased understanding of past ice sheet response to warmer-than-present
      climates is critical to improve models of future climate warming, ice
      sheet melt, and sea level rise. More accurate predictions are necessary
      for policy makers to mitigate future impacts of climate change. Sediment
      cores collected through scientific drilling and coring campaigns provide
      the opportunity to ground truth past environmental conditions and
      associated ice sheet response. Over the last few years there have been a
      number of polar campaigns to collect cores for this purpose, including
      several International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions to the
      Antarctic (374: Ross Sea West Antarctic Ice Sheet \[WAIS] History; 379:
      Amundsen Sea WAIS History; 382: Iceberg Alley; and 383 \[DYNAPACC]), as
      well as other collaborative projects such as the Thwaites Glacier
      International Collaboration, SALSA, etc. In late 2022, the IODP drilling
      vessel *JOIDES Resolution* will begin operations in the North Atlantic,
      with Exp. 400 to NW Greenland already scheduled and several other
      proposals to drill in the Greenland/Arctic region available to schedule in
      2023–2024. Additionally, other non-IODP campaigns to Greenland are in
      progress. Sediment cores collected by these campaigns are crucial to
      investigate the stability of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets under
      past warm environments and to provide analog scenarios for ice retreat and
      consequent sea level rise due to future climate warming. To help ensure
      that research results from these sediment cores yield data required to
      improve climate and ice sheet models, we are hosting a one week glacial
      sediment core school to provide an introduction to Polar paleoclimate
      research using such cores. The primary goals of the school are to:


      * Train a cohort of young scientists to interpret the stratigraphy of
      polar marine sediment cores in the context of ice, climate, and
      source-to-sink processes to improve our understanding of past and future
      ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.

      * Prepare young scientists for upcoming Greenland and Antarctic
      expeditions and for their future research.

      * Cultivate the wider polar marine sediments community.


      ## **School Schedule**


      Mornings (Monday–Thursday) will include lectures and an exercise targeted
      to a daily theme, with afternoons dedicated to hands-on activities in the
      Marine and Geology Repository. School participants will be divided into
      \~5 groups and assigned a set of cores. Each day they will collect a
      different dataset on their cores, rotating through 4 laboratories by the
      end of the week. The laboratories include macroscopic core description,
      microscopic (smear slide) analysis, physical property data and downhole
      logging, and chronostratigraphy (integrating bio- and
      magnetostratigraphy). On Friday, each group will spend the morning
      integrating and finalizing results, which they will present in the
      afternoon.


      ## **School Participation**


      We will invite \~25 early career scientists (including graduate students
      and post-docs) to participate in the core school. This will include \~15
      US-based scientists and \~10 international scientists, particularly
      targeting those who are conducting research on recent or upcoming
      campaigns, or who will participate on upcoming cruises. Given the
      diversity of potential topics covered at the school, we envisage
      participants with a variety of specialties, including (but not limited to)
      sedimentology, paleontology, geochemistry, paleomagnetism, physical
      properties, downhole logging, glaciology, and climate/ice sheet modeling.
      Travel support is available from the U.S. National Science Foundation for
      US-based participants and SCAR-INSTANT for international participants.

      ## **Apply to Attend**


      This workshop is funded by NSF and SCAR-INSTANT, with potential additional
      funding from individual IODP member-countries, so we welcome applications
      from scientists in the U.S. and IODP and SCAR member countries
      ([https://www.scar.org/about-us/members/overview/](https://www.scar.org/about-us/members/overview/
      "https://www.scar.org/about-us/members/overview/")). We particularly
      encourage applications from students and early career scientists who are
      participating on upcoming polar expeditions (including non-IODP
      cruises/field work). *We are committed to improving diversity and
      representation in polar geoscience research and welcome applications that
      help to achieve these goals.* The deadline to apply is **7 January 2022**.


      Your application should include the following:


      1. Application form

      2. Short (preferably 2 page) CV or NSF-style biographical sketch

      3. Statement of interest including how the school will advance your career
      in polar science

      4. Letter of support from your advisor (students only, indicate advisor
      name on application form); letters can be sent by you or by your advisor
