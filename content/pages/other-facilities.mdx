      ### Paleomagnetic Laboratory


      The [Paleo-and-Environmental Magnetism
      Laboratory](http://paleomag.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) in the College of
      Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University is
      operated by MGR Director [Dr. Joseph
      Stoner](http://paleomag.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/PI/stoner.html). The
      [P-Mag Lab](http://paleomag.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) is an NSF supported
      OSU facility dedicated to sediment magnetism and a resource for Pacific
      NW, national and international scientific communities. Built around a
      helium free 2G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM)
      optimized for u-channel samples, it plays a strong role in supporting the
      the marine geology repository. For further information on
      paleo-and-environmental magnetic services please contact [Dr. Joseph
      Stoner](http://paleomag.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/PI/stoner.html).


      ### 40Ar/39Ar Geochronology Laboratory


      The [40Ar/39Ar Geochronology
      Laboratory](http://geochronology.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) in the College of
      Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University is
      operated by MGR Director [Dr. Anthony
      Koppers](http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/koppers/). The OSU [Argon
      Geochronology Lab](http://geochronology.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) carries
      out 40Ar/39Ar analyses services for outside researchers all over the
      world, operating two noble gas  mass spectrometers to carry out 40Ar/39Ar
      age determinations. For further information on 40Ar/39Ar analyses and
      services please contact [Dr. Anthony
      Koppers](http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/koppers/).
