  - body: >
      The OSU Marine Sediment Sampling (MARSSAM) facility provides coring and
      dredging services for NSF groups and investigators using the UNOLS fleet
      as well as the USCG ice breaker R/V Healy. Funding for these services to
      United States NSF-funded investigators is provided by the Ship Facilities
      Program, and MARSSAM is also available on a contract basis to non-NSF
      investigators. The OSU coring gear is among the best available in the
      United States, including large-volume and small-volume piston corers, a
      variety of box and kasten corers, as well as multi- and slow corers for
      undisturbed recovery of the sediment-water interface. Seagoing technicians
      from the facility have operated corings and dredging gear on most UNOLS
      vessels.


      Services are customized to fit your needs, and can include use of
      hardware, personnel, deck handling gear, refrigerated shipping vans,
      sample describing materials, and permanent archival in the OSU Marine and
      Geology Repository.
