      #### There are a number of different core types in the OSU-MGR
      collections. Below is a brief guide to help in deciding what type of
      samples to request. There are additional coring devices not listed below.
      Please contact [osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu)
      with any further questions.
