### Introduction

All sample requests need to be submitted through the OSU-MGR online portal. Please browse through the online archive, which provides high resolution petrographic images (whole rocks + thin sections) and detailed descriptions for most samples, and identify and select the samples that support your research project best. In order to request samples, investigators should upload both the standard OSU-MGR rock sample request form (in Excel spreadsheet format) and a written statement of the proposed research in a separate letter (in PDF format).

### Submission Documents

We require that requestors submit two documents with their sample request:
		
##### Statement of Proposed Research

This letter should include a short outline of the intended studies, detailed methods, research objectives, and names and addresses of collaborating investigators. Since many of the submarine rock samples in the OSU-MGR are small in size and/or have been collected at great costs from unique places around the world, it is requested that in the statement special attention is given to the rationale of what to sample, how much, how many samples, and the return of unused materials. Please review all images and descriptions of the rocks prior to requesting samples. Subsequent sample requests during the same investigation should include an additional statement describing progress of the study and stating the need for additional material. Student requests should be submitted through their academic advisor. Maximum two pages. Include your two-page CV or NSF-style biosketch for the PI and/or students and other scientists, if applicable.

##### OSU-MGR Rock Sample Request

Please download, fill out and submit the [Dredge and Dive Sample Request Form](/Rock-Request-Form.xlsx) to osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu. In the form, use the Sample Name (e.g. OSU-EX1504L2-D1-1) shown on the OSU-MGR collection website. Provide a brief summary of the analyses planned for the sample in the Purpose column. State clearly if specific sections of the sample are required (e.g. glassy rinds, fresh or altered rocks sections) in the Material column. Indicate the minimum sample weight (in grams) or volume (in cubic cm or cc) needed in the Sample Size column. Whenever possible, provide alternative dives or dredges, as some samples may not contain enough material to complete the proposed experiments. Please indicate whether it is a primary or alternate sample in the Request Type column. Please specify if any specific sample preparation is required (e.g. no saw marks) in the Comments column.

### Note about Thin Sections

Most samples contain a prepared petrographic thin section that has been polished to 1 Âµm grit. These sections are available to borrow upon request. As high resolution plane-polarized and cross-polarized photos of these thin sections are already available in the OSU-MGR database, we ask that thin sections only be requested if SEM, EMP, FTIR or similar experiments are to be undertaken. Indicate if the thin sections will be coated and with what material in the sample request letter. We request that thin sections be returned to the repository within two years or upon completion of the proposed research project.

### Approval and Sampling

**Review Process.** The sample request form and research statement will be reviewed by the OSU-MGR curatorial staff and the co-directors. Initial requests for pilot studies should be considered in order to determine if more samples will be required later. Large sample requests (&gt;10 samples) may be subject to a more strenuous review, potentially requiring feedback from outside the OSU-MGR curatorial staff and directors.

**Obligations.** Results from all work on requested samples are expected to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Please send a PDF of any published data from the samples. Failure to publish data on requested samples may result in the denial of future requests. If the publication obligation cannot be met within three years from the sample request, a written report explaining the reasons for non-publication is expected as is the return of all unused materials. All thin sections requested are to be return within two years.

**Sampling at the OSU-MGR.** You or your student(s) are welcome to come to the facility to subsample the rocks yourself; otherwise we will process and send the requested samples. Please contact us at osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu to establish a date and time for the onsite OSU-MGR sampling visit.
