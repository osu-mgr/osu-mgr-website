      The OSU MGR offers numerous services including curation, sampling, and
      nondestructive analyses.


      The OSU MGR is bound by NSF OCE [data
      policy](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2011/nsf11060/nsf11060.pdf) for all
      NSF/OCE/MGG funded projects (please refer to parts III and VII).


      ***


      The main core lab is equipped with multiple work benches, sampling tools,
      computer stations, and microscopes. The wet lab contains a fume hood and
      DI water.


      The following equipment is available to users of the OSU-MGR, some of
      which have associated fees used to maintain instrumentation. For a list of
      fees, see the Fees tab. To use our equipment and/or instrumentation listed
      below, please submit an [Analytical Request](/analytical-requests).


      * A GEOTEK MSCL-S multi-sensor track (MST) for **whole core** that
      provides gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, loop magnetic
      susceptibility (MS), P-wave velocity (PWA) and electrical resistivity (ER)

      * A GEOTEK MSCL-S multi-sensor track (MST) for **split core** that
      provides gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, loop or point-source
      magnetic susceptibility (MS), P-wave velocity (PWA), electrical
      resistivity (ER), and line scan camera

      * A GEOTEK XZ system that provides line scan camera photography and
      point-source magnetic susceptibility (MS)

      * A GEOTEK XYZ system that provides point-source magnetic susceptibility
      (MS), handheld XRF, and color spectrophotometry

      * An ITRAX XRF Scanner capable of split core and u-channel measurement at
      fine-scale resolution

      * CT scanner, courtesy of OSU College of Veterinary Medicine

      * GEOTEK Core Splitter

      * Rock saws

      * Rock drill press

      * Freeze dryers

      * Electronic balances

      * Two -30Â°C upright freezers

      * Microscopes (petrographic with digital camera and binocular)

      * Rock photography station (Canon)

      * Automated label makers
