      ## Introduction


      The OSU-MGR is the largest facility of its kind in the country. With the
      2018 addition of the Antarctic Core Collection (previously housed at
      Florida State University) the repository now archives over 24 miles of
      sediment core and more than 10,000 rocks.


      Researchers around the world can access these samples to investigate a
      wide range of questions about Earthâ€™s history and processes.


      In this video, OSU faculty Joe Stoner, Maureen Walczak, and Maziet Cheseby
      discuss the repository and what can be learned from cores.
