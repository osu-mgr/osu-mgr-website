      ## How to Collect a Core


      Box cores, multi cores, piston cores, vibracores, kasten cores, push
      cores- these are all methods scientists use to collect samples of the
      seafloor. Which method to use? It depends- where is the coring taking
      place? what is the scientific goal? what are the capabilities of the ship?
      Below you can learn more about two of these methods, piston cores and push
      cores.

      ## Piston Cores


      The majority of the cores in the repository are piston cores because it is
      the most effective way to collect long cores. Longer cores go further back
      in time. Hereâ€™s how piston coring works.

      ## Push Cores


      It is not always possible to take a piston core. The sediment type, the
      ocean conditions, the water depth- all present challenges to collecting
      cores. But determined scientists find other ways to get their samples. The
      video below shows OSU graduate students collecting a core in an Oregon
      salt marsh.
