Which method to use? It depends- where is the coring taking place? what is the scientific goal? what are the capabilities of the ship? Below you can learn more about two of these methods, piston cores and push cores."

Thank you again for presenting at the Midsummer Conference. The students found your workshop informative and really interesting. They liked the chance to do hands-on activities, your workshop in particular got great reviews and one student called it one of the best highlights of his whole summer! Way to go!”  \n–Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering Coordinator\n\n“Dear Core Lab. On behalf of the SED 513/514 class I would like to thank you for your discussion, tour, and hands on activity for the class. This opportunity allowed the class to grasp the enormity of data collection and analysis when conducting scientific research.”  \n–SED 513/514 Instructor"
