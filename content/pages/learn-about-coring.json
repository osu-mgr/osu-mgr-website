Which method to use? It depends- where is the coring taking place? what is the scientific goal? what are the capabilities of the ship? Below you can learn more about two of these methods, piston cores and push cores."

But determined scientists find other ways to get their samples. The video below shows OSU graduate students collecting a core in an Oregon salt marsh."
