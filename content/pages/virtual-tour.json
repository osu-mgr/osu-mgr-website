With the 2018 addition of the Antarctic Core Collection (previously housed at Florida State University) the repository now archives over 24 miles of sediment core and more than 10,000 rocks.\n\nResearchers around the world can access these samples to investigate a wide range of questions about Earth’s history and processes.\n\nIn this video, OSU faculty Joe Stoner, Maureen Walczak, and Maziet Cheseby discuss the repository and what can be learned from cores."
