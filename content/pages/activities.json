[This activity ](http://core-repository.coas.oregonstate.edu/Collection/CoreActivity/GSOSWStemapalooza_OSUMGRActivity_Instructions.pdf)is aimed at K-8th graders, using supplies from home or available at craft stores.\n* In April 2019, OSU’s [SMILE ](https://smile.oregonstate.edu/)program participants (middle and high school students from around Oregon) toured the OSU-MGR and participated in hands-on experiments looking at records of tsunamis in marine sediments. [This activity ](http://core-repository.coas.oregonstate.edu/Collection/CoreActivity/TsunamiSand_LabActivity_Peck.pdf)was developed by CEOAS grad student Erin Peck and is aimed at middle and high school and early college students.\n* Designed for undergrad students, this [core lab activity](http://core-repository.coas.oregonstate.edu/core-activity) is a virtual lesson that uses cores from the OSU-MGR to explore sediments of the world’s oceans.\n\n### Additional Activities\n\nCEOAS has numerous activities for students to explore earth sciences.
