      At the OSU Marine and Geology Repository (OSU-MGR) we distribute thousands
      of sediment and hard rock samples on an annual basis to researchers all
      over the world. Instructions on how to request these samples from the
      OSU-MGR and our Sample and Data Policies are detailed below. Please go
      step-by-step through the following six steps:


      **Step 1:** Decide which samples you wish to study and request. For a
      description of the various types of samples, please refer to the Sample
      Types tab above. You can find an inventory of OSU holdings on the [Index
      to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples
      (IMLGS)](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geosamples/index.jsp?inst=OSU) website
      and on our [Main OSU collection](/collections) and [NOAA
      collections](/noaa-ex) pages.


      **Step 2:** Read and familiarize yourself with the sample distribution
      policies and guidelines on how to request samples. Note that these are
      slightly different for sediment and hard rock requests.


      **Step 3:** Download and complete the Sediment and Rock Core Sample
      Request Form or Dredge and Dive Sample Request Form


      **Step 4:** Send the completed form with appropriate documentation (see
      guidelines above) to the curator at
      [osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu) via email.


      **Step 5:** If you publish on the samples you request from the OSU-MGR
      then please acknowledge the OSU-MGR in your manuscript.


      **Step 6:** Please send us copies (PDFâ€™s), or links to published content
      that use samples hosted in our collection.


      For more information on how to request samples or how to request samples
      other than sediments and rocks, please contact us via email at
      [osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:osu-mgr@oregonstate.edu).
